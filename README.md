## Introduction

In today's interconnected world, networks face numerous threats. From malicious actors attempting to intercept data to natural disasters that can disrupt services, maintaining network resilience is more important than ever. This repository provides a framework for understanding and analyzing the protocols that ensure data integrity and availability even under adverse conditions.

The project aims to provide tools, analyses, and resources that help researchers and practitioners understand how to build resilient networks. 

## Project Goals

1. **Analyze Modern Protocols**: Examine current network protocols to understand their strengths and weaknesses in adversarial settings.
2. **Promote Best Practices**: Share best practices for designing resilient networks that can withstand various threats.
3. **Facilitate Research**: Provide a platform for researchers to collaborate and share findings in the field of network resilience.
4. **Develop Tools**: Create tools that assist in the analysis and optimization of network traffic, enhancing security and efficiency.

## Key Topics

This project covers several important topics in the field of network resilience:

- **Adversarial Networks**: Understanding how networks behave under attack and the strategies to mitigate these threats.
- **Computer Network Privacy**: Ensuring that data remains confidential and secure from unauthorized access.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Exploring methods that adversaries use to bypass security measures and how to counteract them.
- **Network Analysis**: Techniques for assessing network performance and security.
- **Network Resilience**: Strategies for maintaining network functionality during and after adverse events.
- **Scientific Research**: Contributions to the academic community through data, findings, and tools.
- **Security Threat Model**: Identifying potential threats and assessing their impact on network security.
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: Techniques to disguise network traffic to enhance privacy and security.
- **Traffic Optimization**: Methods for improving the efficiency and performance of network traffic.
